[Shouldiusewcf.com](https://shouldiusewcf.com/) is a small webpage that was created just because I was frustrated during configuring and bug fixing a bunch of WCF services.

My problem with WCF or soap services is not with the technology itself, it is more that most developers have a very limited skill set and knowledge of Wcf or soap. The reason for that is probably that most of the developers want to use REST services and json instead of touching Wcf, Soap and xml. A proper cofigured Wcf and soap service can be nice to work with and secure. There are a ton of options and the Microsoft concept of auto-generate the contract is another pain in the ass that most prople use if they are in the Microsoft world and need to consume WCF service.
